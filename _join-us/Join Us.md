Volunteering provides opportunity to change people's lives, as well as your own. It gives you the satisfaction of helping people who may not be able to help themselves.
At SPARKS, we offer a myriad of volunteering opportunities that cater to your different interests. Whether you are interested in joining as a regular member or to initiate new ideas for a new cause-based group, we want to hear from you.
