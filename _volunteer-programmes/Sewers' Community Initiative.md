			<b>Programme Description:</b><br>
			The Sewers’ Community Initiative was started by Sembawang Family Service Centre (SFSC) with the aim of providing women from lower-income families the opportunity to supplement their household income through sewing assignments. SFSC works towards helping clients learn sewing skills and capacity-build. Clients will learn how to use a sewing machine to make upcycled products such as tote bags, masks, pouches etc, from donated materials such as used banners.<br>
<br>We are looking for volunteers for the following areas:<br>

<br><b>2)	Interest Group</b><br>
•	Sewing enthusiasts who have interest or experience in sewing, to share their knowledge and skills with other volunteers/clients, and take on sewing projects. Through building this support network, we hope to help clients sew products for sale, with the proceeds going to support low-income families.<br>
