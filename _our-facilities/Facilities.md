**Community Lounge**<br>

The Community Lounge is both cosy and funky at the same time. It is the perfect spot to spark off creative ideas, have an impromptu meeting or hold mobile exhibitions. An ideal venue for volunteers to gather for discussions, share ideas or simply to unwind.
The area is also open to visitors where they can access the interactive touchscreens to find out more about SPARKS and the list of volunteering opportunities. 

**Seminar Room**<br> 
The modern seminar room is flexible and can be easily adapted to various types of events. Air-conditioned and furnished with presentation TV screen and projector, the room offers a comfortable space for discussions, holding workshops or training.
